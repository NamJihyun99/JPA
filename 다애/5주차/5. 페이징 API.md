### 2. 페이징 API
#### 1. setFirstResult(int startPosition) : 조회 시작 위치(0부터 시작)
#### 2. setMaxResults(int maxResult) : 조회할 데이터 수

```sql
TypedQuery<Member> query = em.createQuery("select m from Member m ORDER BY m.username DESC",
                          Member.class);
query.setFirstResult(10);
query.setMaxResults(20);
query.getResultList();
```
* 11번째 부터 시작해서 20건의 데이터 조회
* 데이터 방언 덕분에 데이터베이스마다 다른 페이징 처리를 같은 API로 처리 가능

```sql
1. HSQLDB

SELECT 
  M.ID AS ID,
  M.AGE AS AGE,
  M.TEAM_ID AS TEAM_ID,
  M.NAME AS NAME
FROM 
  MEMBER M
ORDER BY
  M.NAME DESC OFFSET ? LIMIT ?
```
```sql
2. MySQL

SELECT 
  M.ID AS ID,
  M.AGE AS AGE,
  M.TEAM_ID AS TEAM_ID,
  M.NAME AS NAME
FROM 
  MEMBER M
ORDER BY
  M.NAME DESC LIMIT ?, ?
```
```sql
3. PostgreSQL

SELECT 
  M.ID AS ID,
  M.AGE AS AGE,
  M.TEAM_ID AS TEAM_ID,
  M.NAME AS NAME
FROM 
  MEMBER M
ORDER BY
  M.NAME DESC LIMIT ? OFFSET ?
```
```sql
4. 오라클

SELECT *
FROM
  ( SELECT ROW_.*, ROWNUM ROWNUM_
  FROM
    ( SELECT
          M.ID AS ID,
          M.AGE AS AGE,
          M.TEAM_ID AS TEAM_ID
          M.NAME AS NAME
      FROM MEMBER M
      ORDER BY M.NAME
      ) ROW_
   WHERE ROWNUM <= ?
   )
WHERE ROWNUM_ > ?
```
```sql
5. SQLServer

WITH query AS{
  SELECT 
  inner_query.*,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) as
      __hibernate_row_nr__
  FROM
    ( select
        TOP(?) m.id as id,
        m.age as age,
        m.team_id as team_id,
        m.name as name
      from Member m
      order by m.name DESC
      ) inner_query
)
SELECT id, age, team_id, name
FROM query
WHERE __hibernate_row_nr__ >= ? AND __hibernate_row_nr__ < ?
```
